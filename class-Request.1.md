### class: Request

Whenever the page sends a request, the following events are emitted by puppeteer's page:
- ['request'](#event-request) emitted when the request is issued by the page.
- ['response'](#event-response) emitted when/if the response is received for the request.
- ['requestfinished'](#event-requestfinished) emitted when the response body is downloaded and the request is complete.

If request fails at some point, then instead of 'requestfinished' event (and possibly instead of 'response' event), the  ['requestfailed'](#event-requestfailed) event is emitted.

If request gets a 'redirect' response, the request is successfully finished with the 'requestfinished' event, and a new request is  issued to a redirected url.

#### request.abort([errorCode])
- `errorCode` <[string]> Optional error code. Defaults to `failed`, could be
  one of the following:
  - `aborted` - An operation was aborted (due to user action)
  - `accessdenied` - Permission to access a resource, other than the network, was denied
  - `addressunreachable` - The IP address is unreachable. This usually means
    that there is no route to the specified host or network.
  - `connectionaborted` - A connection timed out as a result of not receiving an ACK for data sent.
  - `connectionclosed` - A connection was closed (corresponding to a TCP FIN).
  - `connectionfailed` - A connection attempt failed.
  - `connectionrefused` - A connection attempt was refused.
  - `connectionreset` - A connection was reset (corresponding to a TCP RST).
  - `internetdisconnected` - The Internet connection has been lost.
  - `namenotresolved` - The host name could not be resolved.
  - `timedout` - An operation timed out.
  - `failed` - A generic failure occurred.
- returns: <[Promise]>

Aborts request. To use this, request interception should be enabled with `page.setRequestInterception`.
Exception is immediately thrown if the request interception is not enabled.

#### request.continue([overrides])
- `overrides` <[Object]> Optional request overwrites, which can be one of the following:
  - `url` <[string]> If set, the request url will be changed
  - `method` <[string]> If set changes the request method (e.g. `GET` or `POST`)
  - `postData` <[string]> If set changes the post data of request
  - `headers` <[Object]> If set changes the request HTTP headers
- returns: <[Promise]>

Continues request with optional request overrides. To use this, request interception should be enabled with `page.setRequestInterception`.
Exception is immediately thrown if the request interception is not enabled.

#### request.failure()
- returns: <?[Object]> Object describing request failure, if any
  - `errorText` <[string]> Human-readable error message, e.g. `'net::ERR_FAILED'`.

The method returns `null` unless this request was failed, as reported by
`requestfailed` event.

输出所有失败请求示例:

```js
page.on('requestfailed', request => {
  console.log(request.url() + ' ' + request.failure().errorText);
});
```

#### request.frame()
- returns: <?[Frame]> A matching [Frame] object, or `null` if navigating to error pages.

#### request.headers()
- returns: <[Object]> An object with HTTP headers associated with the request. All header names are lower-case.

#### request.method()
- returns: <[string]> Request's method (GET, POST, etc.)

#### request.postData()
- returns: <[string]> Request's post body, if any.

#### request.redirectChain()
- returns: <[Array]<[Request]>>

A `redirectChain` is a chain of requests initiated to fetch a resource.
- If there are no redirects and the request was successful, the chain will be empty.
- If a server responds with at least a single redirect, then the chain will
contain all the requests that were redirected.

`redirectChain` is shared between all the requests of the same chain.

For example, if the website `http://example.com` has a single redirect to
`https://example.com`, then the chain will contain one request:

```js
const response = await page.goto('http://example.com');
const chain = response.request().redirectChain();
console.log(chain.length); // 1
console.log(chain[0].url()); // 'http://example.com'
```

If the website `https://google.com` has no redirects, then the chain will be empty:
```js
const response = await page.goto('https://google.com');
const chain = response.request().redirectChain();
console.log(chain.length); // 0
```

#### request.resourceType()
- returns: <[string]>

Contains the request's resource type as it was perceived by the rendering engine.
ResourceType will be one of the following: `document`, `stylesheet`, `image`, `media`, `font`, `script`, `texttrack`, `xhr`, `fetch`, `eventsource`, `websocket`, `manifest`, `other`.

#### request.respond(response)
- `response` <[Object]> Response that will fulfill this request
  - `status` <[number]> Response status code, defaults to `200`.
  - `headers` <[Object]> Optional response headers
  - `contentType` <[string]> If set, equals to setting `Content-Type` response header
  - `body` <[Buffer]|[string]> Optional response body
- returns: <[Promise]>

Fulfills request with given response. To use this, request interception should
be enabled with `page.setRequestInterception`. Exception is thrown if
request interception is not enabled.

An example of fulfilling all requests with 404 responses:

```js
await page.setRequestInterception(true);
page.on('request', request => {
  request.respond({
    status: 404,
    contentType: 'text/plain',
    body: 'Not Found!'
  });
});
```

> **NOTE** Mocking responses for dataURL requests is not supported.
> Calling `request.respond` for a dataURL request is a noop.

#### request.response()
- returns: <?[Response]> A matching [Response] object, or `null` if the response has not been received yet.

#### request.url()
- returns: <[string]> URL of the request.
